# Ask me anything!

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. It is forked from
[@holman's feedback repo](https://github.com/holman/feedback) (by way of [@mdo's joint](https://github.com/mdo/ama)) and seems like a pretty fantastic idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, and the like.

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

Guidelines:

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)

## TL;DR on myself

Here's a little background on me: I've been [working for GitHub](https://github.com/blog/1522-joel-glovier-is-a-githubber) since 2013, and I've been doing design professionally since 2004. I've worked remotely for my clients and employers for most of my career. I [contribute](https://github.com/jglovier?tab=repositories) [regularly](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-frontend/graphs/contributors) [to open source](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/graphs/contributors) projects, and I do both design and front-end dev type stuff. I've also got a [life](https://github.com/jglovier/project-car) [outside](https://github.com/jglovier/house-upkeep/issues) of the work things, so those topics are fair game too, if you're interested.

*NOTE: If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you're better off 
[asking GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact), since you'll
end up getting a much faster response back that way.*
