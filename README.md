# Ask me anything

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. It is forked from
[@holman's feedback repo](https://github.com/holman/feedback) (by way of [@mdo's joint](https://github.com/mdo/ama) :wink:) and seems like a pretty fantastic idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, and the like.

I'm not an real or internet celebrity, so why would I do this, you ask? Because sometimes people have questions about stuff that I might have answers too, so why not!

Here's a little background on me: I've been working for GitHub since June 2013, and I've been doing design professionally since 2004. I've worked remotely for my clients and employers for most of my career. I contribute regularly to open source projects, and I do both design and front-end dev type stuff. I've also got a life outside of the work things, so those topics are fair game too, if you're interested.

*NOTE: If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you're better off 
[asking GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact), since you'll
end up getting a much faster response back that way.*

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/jglovier/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/jglovier/ama/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.
