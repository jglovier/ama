# How this repo works

## Open an issue to ask a question

Just open an issue for whatever question you want to ask! I'll respond as soon as I am able. 

You should be aware that this is a public repository, so the content you post here will be visible to the public.

I'm happy to answer any questions that are professional or personal in nature as long as they are in good taste.

Sometimes I might not have a good answer for your question (unfortunately, I can't tell you the winning powerball number for the next drawing...), but I'll do my best to give you a good answer if I have one!
